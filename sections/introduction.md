Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task whose goal is to identify and classify parts of unstructured text in order to further understand and processes data.

A major effort in creating an NER model is annotating a corpus of text that will be fed into the machine learning process. This application is a solution that streamlines this training step by providing a simple yet flexible user interface with tools to help integrate the data into your system.
